    <h3> <strong> Description </strong></h3>
    <p>A true French omelette, or omelet as we Americans call it, is just eggs and butter, 
        no filling. The egg is folded for a soft, tender texture.</p>
    <p>According to Alan Davidson, the French word omelette (French: [ɔm. lɛt]) came into 
        use during the mid-16th century, but the versions alumelle and alumete are employed 
        by the Ménagier de Paris (II, 4 and II, 5) in 1393.</p>
