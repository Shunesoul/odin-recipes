    <h1>French Omelette</h1>
    <img src="/home/shunesoul/odin-recipes/odin-recipes/images/Omelette.jpeg" alt="">
    <h3> <strong> Description </strong></h3>
    <p>A true French omelette, or omelet as we Americans call it, is just eggs and butter, 
        no filling. The egg is folded for a soft, tender texture.</p>
    <p>According to Alan Davidson, the French word omelette (French: [ɔm. lɛt]) came into 
        use during the mid-16th century, but the versions alumelle and alumete are employed 
        by the Ménagier de Paris (II, 4 and II, 5) in 1393.</p>
    <h3> <strong> Ingredients </strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 tspn Sea Salt</li>
        <li>2.5 Tbspn Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1 tspn Chopped herbs such as Chives or Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, using a fork, whisk the eggs with the salt until they’re thoroughly yum combined.

        </li>
        <li>In an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Slowly pour in the eggs. Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is just set, about 30 seconds.

        </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low. Use a heatproof silicone spatula to constantly push the eggs around in the pan, scrambling them until soft, creamy curds form, but they are not completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Gently spread the eggs into an even layer in the pan, pushing any runny parts towards the edges of the pan. Once the edges are cooked, about 1 more minute. Remove the skillet from the heat.

        </li>
        <li>Tilt the skillet away from you at a 45 degree angle. Use the spatula to carefully lift the edge closest to you and roll the eggs slowly over themselves to create a smooth cylindrical shape. Transfer to a plate and spread the remaining ½ tablespoon of butter on top of the omelette.

        </li>
        <li>Use the spatula to gently turn the finished omelette out of the pan onto a plate, seam side down.

        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle fresh herbs over the top and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
